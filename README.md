# Creator AI Brain 

This is the codebase for the Creator AI Brain app that I developed in this video. It lets you generate video titles for the top 3 most famous creators: MrBeast, Ryan Trahan, and Airrack.

## Local development

Before starting this project, you will need to setup an OpenAI account and get a API key.

Then create a `.env` file and put that key there:
`REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key`

You can now start this project by running the following command from the root folder:

`npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
